> WARNING: This is a work in progress

## Dependencies

Keccak/SHA3:  https://github.com/szktty/erlang-sha3.git

RocksDB:  https://github.com/project-fifo/erlang-rocksdb.git

RocksDB tests expect the LZO (`lzo2`) library to be installed on your machine and the CXX paths set up correctly. If you have problems compiling try using: `make compile` rather than just `make`.
